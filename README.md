# Custom-CNN-Model

Final project for the course Introduction to Machine Learning (CS680)

In this project, we have tried to build our custom CNN model, which is then trained on a Human actions dataset also created by us. The idea is to try to build a novel CNN model which performs better than the traditional Machine Learning models and Deep Learning models like AlexNet, DenseNet, ResNet50, VGG16 on this dataset. 

Here is the architecture of our proposed custom CNN model.
